glGetString(GL_VERSION) returns the version the current GL context is providing,
not necessarily the highest version your GL implementation is supporting.

GLEW has nothing to do with that, it just loads GL function pointers.
Relevant is the way you created the context. What you see here is the normal behavior
of the nvidia driver in recent versions: when you ask it for some GL x.y context, it does return version x.y,
and not a higher version it would still support.

If you want a 4.5 context, just request a GL 4.5 context. How to do that depends on the way you create the context.
If you use some libraries like GLFW, GLUT, SDL, Qt, ..., just consult the documentation on how to request a specific
context version. If you manually create the context via glX, use glXCreateContextAttribsARB with proper
GLX_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION_ARB and GLX_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION_ARB attributes.
